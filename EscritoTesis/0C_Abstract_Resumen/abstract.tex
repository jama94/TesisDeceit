Researchers in psychology and computer science are interested in applying different methodologies to detect if a person says deceit or truth statements automatically.
There are different approaches to detect deceit, such as physiological reactions, verbal language, and nonverbal language which suggest that a liar person has different behaviors than people who tell the truth, but these behaviors are not generalizable to all people since a clue that reveals a lie in one person, does not necessarily indicate a lie in another. This has been the main problem in developing a system that is automatic and capable of detecting lies in any individual.
This paper presents a model based on deep neural networks capable of classifying videos into truths and lies using the non-verbal language of the face, applying spatial filters to the frames contained in a video, at low cost, without being an invasive system and without the need of experts who must analyze the information obtained by the model manually.
The results obtained show that videos can be classified as truth or deceit with an accuracy of 82 \% with the \textit{Within-Individual} methodology and beating human judgment to detect deceit and truths in videos.\\
